This file makes heavy use of preprocesser conditionals and macros.  Your
compiler must support the preprocessor.  If it does not, you can run it
through the standard C preprocessor.

Below is a list of the recommended compiler invocations for various compilers
and compile types.  Because of the way the loops are constructed, I have found
that -O2 is actiually quite a bit faster than -O3.

Additionally, the macros cause line lengths greater than 132, so you must tell
your compiler to accept arbitarily long lines.

Rember, with MPI you must execute the program with mpirun or mpiexec!

I have done the best I can in finding as many compiler and MPI variants as I
have available to me.

Serial compilation:

ifort -O2 npvol.F90 -o NPVol
gfortran -O2 -ffree-line-length-none npvol.F90 -o NPVol 

OpenMP compilation:

ifort -O2 -openmp npvol.F90 -o NPVol
gfortran -O2 -fopenmp -ffree-line-length-none npvol.F90 -o NPVol 

OpenMPI compilation:

OMPI_FC=ifort mpif90 -O2 -D_MPI npvol.F90 -o NPVol
OMPI_FC=gfortran mpif90 -O2 -D_MPI -ffree-line-length-none npvol.F90 -o NPVol

MPICH compilation

mpif90 -f90=ifort -O2 -D_MPI npvol.F90 -o NPVol
mpif90 -f90=gfortran -O2 -D_MPI -ffree-line-length-none npvol.F90 -o NPVol
